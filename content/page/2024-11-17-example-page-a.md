For this assignment we are making a museum catalog for an exhibition called _Onderkruipsels_, which is all about small, “creepy” creatures like beetles, lizards, and mice. The exibition was organized by the _Rijksmuseum_ in Amsterdam so we used a portion of the text from the real organization and official photos from the museum. The goal was to make an interesting but clean design which would be fun to look at while walking through the museum.

I tried to achieve a combination of traditional and modern elements to honour the history that's being talked about without being old-fashioned.
